# Classification_BodyPostures

The objective of this study is to conduct a comparative analysis of various machine learning models that classify the posture of a human based on their coordinates captured on wearable devices through 8 hours of various activities, namely sitting-down, standing-up, standing, walking, and sitting. Exploratory data analysis and statistical analyses would also aid understanding of the key drivers of change in posture such as body mass, weight, height and age. Through this study, we aim to compare performances of support vector machines, boosted decision trees and artificial neural networks in order to propose the most accurate model for this data.
